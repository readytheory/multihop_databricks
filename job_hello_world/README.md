## Hello, World for Apache Spark

This project is all about setting up the environment, not about domain specific work.  The goal is
to learn and document how to get code run in a repeatable way.

Some goals, in rough order of difficulty:
- Using the GUI, define a job that writes out a file with the time to S3
- Run that  job via the API
